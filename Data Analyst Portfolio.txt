____________Inspecting data___________________

SELECT * FROM Portfolio. dbo.Sales_Sample
SELECT * FROM  Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample;


___________Checking Unique Values_____________________

SELECT DISTINCT (STATUS) FROM  Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample;
SELECT DISTINCT (YEAR_ID) FROM  Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample;
SELECT DISTINCT (PRODUCTLINE) FROM  Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample;
SELECT DISTINCT (COUNTRY) FROM  Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample;
SELECT DISTINCT (DEALSIZE) FROM  Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample;
SELECT DISTINCT (TERRITORY) FROM  Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample;

______________ Analysis___________________________

1- Sales by Productline (let's see which products sell the most )
  Syntax: 
SELECT 
  PRODUCT LINE, SUM(SALES) AS [Total Sales]
FROM Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample
GROUP BY PRODUCT LINE
ORDER BY [Total Sales] DESC 
                                        * classic cars is the best product line they have 

2- Checking the sales Across the year 
  Syntax :
   SELECT 
  YEAR_ID, SUM(SALES) AS [Total Sales]
FROM Portfoliodb. dbo.sales_data_sample
GROUP BY YEAR_ID
ORDER BY [Total Sales] DESC 
                                       * It appears that 2004 is the year that they made the Most Sales

SELECT DISTINCT (MONTH_ID) FROM  Portfoliodb. dbo.sales_data_sample
where YEAR_ID = 2005
It appears that they operated just for 5 months
                                      * now we see the reason why the sales in 2005 is pretty low 

3-Checking the deal size
 Syntax:
  SELECT 
  DEAL SIZE, SUM(SALES) AS [Total Sales]
FROM Portfoliodb. dbo.sales_data_sample
GROUP BY DEAL SIZE
ORDER BY [Total Sales] DESC 
                                    * Apparently the medium deals sized are the ones that generate the most revenue
 
4-Best month for sales Per Year
What was the best month for sales in a specific year? How much was earned that month?
Syntax:
SELECT 
    MONTH_ID, 
	SUM (SALES) AS [Total Sales],
	COUNT(ORDER NUMBER) AS [Frequency]
FROM Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample
where YEAR_ID = 2003 (change the year to see the rest)
GROUP BY MONTH_ID
ORDER BY  [Total Sales] DESC 

5-what product line sells Most in Best Month?
 Syntax:
 SELECT 
    MONTH_ID, PRODUCT LINE,
	SUM (SALES) AS [Total Sales],
	COUNT(ORDER NUMBER) AS [Frequency]
FROM Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample
where YEAR_ID = 2003 AND MONTH_ID = 11
GROUP BY MONTH_ID,PRODUCT LINE
ORDER BY  [Total Sales] DESC 

6- Who is the best customer (this could be answered with RFM)
   Syntax:
   SELECT 
 CUSTOMER NAME,
SUM(SALES) AS MonetaryValue,
AVG(SALES) AS Avgmonetaryvalue,
Count(ORDER NUMBER) AS Frequency,
MAX(order date) AS last_order_date,
(SELECT MAX(ORDERDATE) FROM Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample)  Max_order_date,
DATEDIFF(DD,MAX(ORDERDATE),(SELECT MAX(ORDERDATE) FROM Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample))  Recency
FROM Portfoliodb.dbo.sales_data_sample
GROUP BY CUSTOMER NAME
